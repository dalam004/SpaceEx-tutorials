Note that it is not possible to directly run the executable file in Windows. The executables are created for Linux and macOS. It might be possible with cygwin but not advised. On the contrary, the recommended way would be to create a new Virtual Machine and install Linux (also possible with macOS). \n\n\n\n\nDownload OS\n. The first step is to download a 32- or 64-bit Linux distribution (e.g. \nUbuntu\n or \nDebian\n. We recommend the 64-bit version as it supports the latest SpaceEx version.\n\n\nDownload VM\n. There are several options, notably Oracle \nVirtualBox\n (1st option for Windows host) or \nVMmare Player\n. Our recommendation would be the former.\n\n\nSet up new VM\n. Once the VM application is downloaded, a new VM should be created and set up. For VirtualBox, simply open the application, navigate to option \nNew\n  (on top-left), select \nLinux\n and version (e.g. 64-debian), memory size (over 2 GB is typically enough), \nCreate a virtual machine now\n, \nVDI\n, \ndynamically allocated\n and size over \n8GB\n.\n\n\nInstall OS\n. Now, a new virtual machine should be created (appears on the left) and you shall select \nstart\n. The option \nSelect Start-up disk\n pops up and you should add the location of the downloaded ISO file (64-bit Linux). Now, it is possible to install Linux. There will be several questions similar to a Windows installation.\n\n\nSet up Linux\n. There are numerous  tutorials on the \nbasic Linux commands\n. The necessary actions to setup your Linux for SpaceEx use follow.\n\n\nOpen terminal (Ubuntu: press Dash, Debian: press  Activities, and then search for Terminal).\n\n\n\n\nGain root access by \n$ su\n\n(\n$\n is used for clarity, it should not be added in the terminal) and insert your password.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$ apt-get install sudo\n\n\n\n\n$ sudo apt-get install build-essential\n\n\n$ sudo apt-get update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload SpaceEx\n. Depending on the OS you have downloaded, select the corresponding executable file from \nSpaceEx website\n. That is \nSpaceEx command line executable v0.9.8f\n for 64 bit Linux or \nSpaceEx command line executable v0.9.8e\n (64 bit Mac OS X)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse SpaceEx from command line\n.\n\n\n\n\nRun SpaceEx\n\n\n\n\nuse command \ncd\n to change directory (to the folder you saved the spaceex files). For example, \n$ cd /home/user/Downloads/spaceex\\_exe\n.\nIf you cannot cd with root privilege, press exit (to leave root) and then write the aforementioned command.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nuntil you get familiar with paths and directories, save your xml and cfg files in \n/home/user/Downloads/spaceex_exe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnow, you are ready to run spaceex by writing in the terminal: \n./spaceex -g config.cfg -m model.xml -o output\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpaceex will run, show the steps on the terminal screen and save the results in the output file. The results could be numbers (representing the vertices of the reachable sets) or text. \nMore information can be found  at the \nFAQ\n.\n\n\n\n\nExtra Options\n\n\n\n\nAll the options can be found by writing the command \n$ ./spaceex --help\n on the terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting; there are different ways to plot the reachable sets. For MATLAB users, it is possible to save the 2D results in GEN format and use the \nMatlab script\n for visualization (i.e. \nplot_2d_vertices\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo obtain the flattened/composed hybrid automaton in XML format, you can add the argument \n--output-system-file new_name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun multiple files\n.\n\n\n\n\nThere are two ways to run multiple reachable computations. Either creating new cfg files with multiple configurations (e.g. different initial conditions) or run spaceex with different arguments in the terminal. \n\n\nIf you want to automatically run different configurations, you can run a bash file. Attached you can find a bash file with different configurations. Also, a way to automatically create several cfg files with different initial conditions and names is proposed.\nThe file can be executed by writing in the terminal the following command  \n$ ./run\\_spaceex.sh\n.
