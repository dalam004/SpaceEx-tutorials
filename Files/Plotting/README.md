This folder contains:

- the source code for 2d-plotting of reachable sets with MATLAB (`gen_to_mat.m` and `plot_flowpipe.m`).
- a model example of a pendulum flowpipe in GEN format generated by SpaceEx and named`pend.gen`,
- a file `example_plotting.m` for illustrating the 2d- plotting with Matlab. 
- `plot_polygons_sage.ipynb` a quick solution in Sage. It is not as sophisticated as the solution in Matlab. See also `plot_polygons_sage.html`.

The files `pend.mat` and `pend.png` are generated automatically by the script `example_plotting.m`. See the docstring there for further details.
