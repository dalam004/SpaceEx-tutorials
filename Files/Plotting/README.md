This folder contains:

- the source code for 2d-plotting of reachable sets with MATLAB (`gen_to_mat.m` and `plot_flowpipe.m`).
- a model example of a pendulum flowpipe in GEN format generated by SpaceEx and named`pend.gen`, as well as the file `plotting_template_bball.m` for plotting.
- a model example of a timed automaton flowpipe in GEN format generated by SpaceEx and named`bball_timed.gen`,
as well as the file `plotting_template_pendulum` for plotting.
- `plot_polygons_sage.ipynb` a quick solution in Sage. It is not as sophisticated as the solution in Matlab. 

The files `pend.mat` and `pend.png` are generated automatically by the script `example_plotting.m`. See the docstring there for further details.
